# Open Source 2FAS for iOS

This is the official iOS app for the Open Source 2FAS project.

## What is 2FAS?

2FAS (Two-Factor Authentication Service) is a user authentication method that provides an additional layer of security for online accounts. In addition to a username and password, 2FAS uses a second factor, such as a one-time password (OTP) shown on a user's phone, to verify a user's identity. This helps prevent unauthorized access to accounts, even if a password is compromised.

## Features

- Support for time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) and HMAC-based on-time passwords (HOTP)
- Compatible with any service that supports the TOTP and HOTP standard, including Google, Microsoft, and Dropbox
- Easy to set up and use
